## Introduction

Flowy is designed to streamline your Elixir development process by reducing boilerplate, enhancing productivity, and making development enjoyable. We bring a framework that embodies the magic and simplicity of popular web frameworks, tailored specifically for the Elixir environment.

## Embracing Code Generation Over Metaprogramming

Flowy champions the use of convention over configuration while taking a different path from the metaprogramming-heavy frameworks. We generate the necessary boilerplate code for you, ensuring transparency, performance, and a more intuitive learning experience.
